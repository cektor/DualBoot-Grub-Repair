# DualBoot-Grub-Repair
 This script automates GRUB management tasks on a Linux system. It updates GRUB, reinstalls it if missing, and adds Windows to the GRUB menu if detected. It also checks for the presence of Windows partitions and asks the user to reboot after completing the operations. Requires root privileges for execution.
